* 86% of traffic comes from Google

* 80% of the users are active users, they ask questions and get answers, others just search for the answers and read and use it. 
* Cheaper licensing was attained through Microsoft's BizSpark program. My impression is they pay about $11K for OS and SQL licensing.

* A fourth server was added to run superuser.com. All together the servers also run Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User.

* QNAP TS-409U NAS for backups. Decided not to use a cloud solution because the bandwidth costs of transferring 5 GB of data per day becomes prohibitive.
* Hosting at http://www.peakinternet.com/. Impressed with their detailed technical responses and reasonable hosting rates.
* SQL Server's full text search is used extensively for the site search and detecting if a question has already been asked. Lucene.net is considered an attractive alternative.
