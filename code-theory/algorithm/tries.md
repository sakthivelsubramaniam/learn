# Tries

* It is the Tree that
* Stores a set of strings.
* Any Traversal from root to leaf will represent a word.
* Stores node (except the root), will store a letter in the alphabet
* Ex: s = { bear, bell, bid, bull, stock, stop}.
* For standard trie, no word in S should be a prefix of the other.

## Space Complexities.

Worst Case : 
 If there is no common prefix between the words, there it will be O(n).

## suffix Tries

Ex: Minimize
