 The size of the data warehouses storing this data is increasing permanently, 
  - Five year ago the largest db is in 100 TB now in Peta bytes.
  - Researches indicates,size of the largest db doubles evey three years.
  - Organization collects large unstructed data, like images vides, xml files, csv files etc.
  - For Analyitical system lots of read opertaiton executes over small amount attributes.
  - Several technical solutions can be used to improve system performance, such as partitioning, star indexes, query preprocessing, bitmap and index joins, or hashing.
  - Two major techniques are used to design a data warehouse architecture: symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and massively parallel processing (MPP). 

  # Examples of columnar DB, Sybase IQ,

  ## Sybase IQ

  - It has it own indexing system.
  - Performance Reporting and analytical queries are 100 times faster than normal queries.
  - It compression algorithmn, reduces 30 to 85% of disk space.
  - It requires 260 tb of data storage for storing 1000 tb of input data.
  - It can store up to 500 tb of data.
  - It supports symmentric multi processing.
