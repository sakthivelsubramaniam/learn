## Surround
Delete {existing} surround
`ds{exi­sting} `

Change {existing} surround to {desired}
```cs{exi­sti­ng}­{de­sired}: ```

Add {desired} surround to text defined by {motion}
```ys{mot­ion­}{d­esired}:```

Surround selection when in visual mode
```S{desired}:```



If you type S(, it will be surrounded by spaces. However if you use the closing ) instead S) it will not be surrounded by spaces.

This applies of course to all bracket pair surroundings, <> [] {} (), not merely to (), although the behavior of S< is such that it expects a tag enclosure so only S> is able to surround as <>.
