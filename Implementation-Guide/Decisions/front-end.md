# Key Decisions for front ends

 1. Tech stack
 2. Micro front end / Monolethic front end. 
 3. Native app (win app/ Maui app) vs web App.

## Choosing the tech stack

### Tech Stack

   1. Angular Application
   2. React
   3. Asp.net - MVC - Razor based
   4. Asp.net - win forms
   5. Blazor - server side
   6. Blazor - client side (wasm)
   7. MAUI - multi platform app.

### Drivers are

* Number of load it can support.
* Internal application will be limited by the number of users in the organization.
* Pure SPA application is highly scalable as it runs in individual browers
* Teams familiarity with application technology.
* Cost of scaling the application when server side Blazor is used.
* Signar-R is used and connection state has to be stored in the server. This has to be estimated.
* Is it a progressive app. Whether UI has to build for both mobile and web.
