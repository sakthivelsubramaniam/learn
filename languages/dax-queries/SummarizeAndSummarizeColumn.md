* SummarizeColumn does not support evaluation within context transition
* SummarizeColumn combines all fitlers to a single filter
* Combined table resulting from this filter only contains the column listed in SummarizeColumn or FilterCOlumns
* Filters are applied to group by column from the same table and measures
* It uses autoexists for filters from the same table. It behaves more like relational filters.
